## Problem

In a `r text_spec("weighted alphabet", color = "#0088cc", bold=T)`, every symbol is assigned a positive real number called a `r text_spec("weight", color = "#0088cc", bold=T)` A string formed from a weighted alphabet is called a `r text_spec("weighted string", color = "#0088cc", bold=T)`, and its `r text_spec("weight", color = "#0088cc", bold=T)` is equal to the sum of the weights of its symbols.

The standard weight assigned to each member of the 20-symbol amino acid alphabet is the monoisotopic mass of the corresponding amino acid.

`r text_spec("Given", color = "#46a546", bold=T)`: A protein string ***P*** of length at most 1000 `r text_spec("aa", color = "#0088cc", bold=F)`.

`r text_spec("Return", color = "#46a546", bold=T)`: The total weight of ***P***. Consult the `r text_spec("monoisotopic mass table", color = "#0088cc", bold=T)`.

## Sample Dataset

`SKADYEK`

## Sample Output

`821.392`

```{python}
f=open("rosalind_prtm.txt",'r')
s=f.readlines()[0].replace("\n","")
if len(s)<len(t):
  print("Error: length of substring ",t," is longer than ",s)
  exit()

motifLoci=[]
for i in range(0,len(s)-len(t)):
  tmpText=s[i:i+len(t)]
  if tmpText==t:
    motifLoci.append(i+1)

print("String: "+s)
print("Substring: "+t)
print("Locations of motifs: "+str(motifLoci))
```
